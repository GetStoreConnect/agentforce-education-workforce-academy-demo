# StoreConnect Agentforce Demonstration Code

This is a Salesforce DX project that has the metadata and classes required to power the StoreConnect Workforce Academy demo available at [agentforce-edu.storeconnectdemo.com](https://agentforce-edu.storeconnectdemo.com/).

Currently this project uses the Order record to create the checkout cart and has other limitations. It is a proof of concept only and should only be used as a base to develop out your own StoreConnect powered Agentforce chat agent.

This is an open source repository and no direct Agentforce support is provided by StoreConnect beyond direct help on StoreConnect specific functions. For assistance with Agentforce more generally, please contact one of our StoreConnect partners.

For StoreConnect support please email support@getstoreconnect.com or visit our [help website](https://support.getstoreconnect.com/).
